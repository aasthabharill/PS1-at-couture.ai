# PS1-at-couture.ai
I interned at couture.ai as a part of the Practice School Program at BITS Pilani. This was my first internship and the first time I was working on anything ML related and went through a pretty steep learning curve. The codes and data I worked on were confidential and can't be shared outside, but the report contains some snippets of my code with a brief description of what they achieve. 

### My Contribution to the Semantic Search Team 
1. Implemented improvements to enhance query generation on AJIO's Search Engine by optimizing the Auto-Completion Model through Hyper Parameter Tuning.
2. Achieved over a 10% increase in recall for the BERT Auto Complete Model and reduced computational time by 50%. 
3. Preprocessed Catalog and Search History Datasets using Pandas to ensure generation of efficient results and employed multiple techniques (like Levenshtein distance) to extract results giving the best performance

### Uploads
1. Final Report: The full documentation of the internship which explains the work and concepts I used. There's an Appendix at the end with some code snippets I worked on.
2. Final Diary: A week by week documentation of my learnings throughout the internship.
